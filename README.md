# Pose Detection in the Browser: PoseNet Model


This package contains a standalone model called PoseNet, as well as some demos, for running real-time pose estimation in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

## Installation

You can use this as standalone es5 bundle like this:

```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/posenet"></script>
```

Or you can install it via npm for use in a TypeScript / ES6 project.

```sh
npm install @tensorflow-models/posenet
```

## Usage

Either a single pose or multiple poses can be estimated from an image.
Each methodology has its own algorithm and set of parameters.

### Keypoints

All keypoints are indexed by part id.  The parts and their ids are:

| Id | Part |

| 0 | nose |
| 1 | leftEye |
| 2 | rightEye |
| 3 | leftEar |
| 4 | rightEar |
| 5 | leftShoulder |
